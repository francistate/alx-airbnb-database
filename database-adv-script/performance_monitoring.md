## üîç Performance Monitoring Strategy

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

#### **Query Performance Metrics**
- **Execution Time**: Target <100ms for transactional queries, <500ms for analytical queries
- **Query Frequency**: Identify most frequently executed queries
- **Resource Usage**: CPU, memory, and I/O consumption per query
- **Lock Contention**: Monitor blocking and deadlock situations

#### **Database Health Metrics**
- **Connection Pool Usage**: Monitor active vs. idle connections
- **Buffer Cache Hit Ratio**: Target >95% for optimal performance
- **Index Usage Statistics**: Track index scan vs. sequential scan ratios
- **Table and Index Bloat**: Monitor storage efficiency

#### **System Resource Metrics**
- **CPU Utilization**: Database server CPU usage patterns
- **Memory Usage**: Buffer pool, work memory, and cache efficiency
- **Disk I/O**: Read/write operations and queue depth
- **Network Throughput**: Database connection and data transfer rates

## üìä Performance Analysis Tools and Techniques

### PostgreSQL Built-in Monitoring

#### **pg_stat_statements Extension**
```sql
-- Enable query statistics collection
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS pg_stat_statements;

-- Top queries by execution time
SELECT 
    query,
    calls,
    total_time,
    mean_time,
    min_time,
    max_time,
    stddev_time,
    (total_time / sum(total_time) OVER()) * 100 AS percent_of_total
FROM pg_stat_statements 
ORDER BY total_time DESC 
LIMIT 20;

-- Most frequently called queries
SELECT 
    query,
    calls,
    mean_time,
    total_time
FROM pg_stat_statements 
ORDER BY calls DESC 
LIMIT 20;

-- Queries with highest variability (potential optimization candidates)
SELECT 
    query,
    calls,
    mean_time,
    stddev_time,
    (stddev_time / mean_time) * 100 AS variability_percent
FROM pg_stat_statements 
WHERE calls > 100
ORDER BY variability_percent DESC 
LIMIT 15;
```

#### **Database Activity Monitoring**
```sql
-- Current active queries
SELECT 
    pid,
    now() - pg_stat_activity.query_start AS duration,
    query,
    state,
    wait_event_type,
    wait_event
FROM pg_stat_activity 
WHERE (now() - pg_stat_activity.query_start) > interval '5 minutes'
ORDER BY duration DESC;

-- Lock monitoring
SELECT 
    blocked_locks.pid AS blocked_pid,
    blocked_activity.usename AS blocked_user,
    blocking_locks.pid AS blocking_pid,
    blocking_activity.usename AS blocking_user,
    blocked_activity.query AS blocked_statement,
    blocking_activity.query AS blocking_statement
FROM pg_catalog.pg_locks blocked_locks
    JOIN pg_catalog.pg_stat_activity blocked_activity ON blocked_activity.pid = blocked_locks.pid
    JOIN pg_catalog.pg_locks blocking_locks 
        ON blocking_locks.locktype = blocked_locks.locktype
        AND blocking_locks.DATABASE IS NOT DISTINCT FROM blocked_locks.DATABASE
        AND blocking_locks.relation IS NOT DISTINCT FROM blocked_locks.relation
        AND blocking_locks.page IS NOT DISTINCT FROM blocked_locks.page
        AND blocking_locks.tuple IS NOT DISTINCT FROM blocked_locks.tuple
        AND blocking_locks.virtualxid IS NOT DISTINCT FROM blocked_locks.virtualxid
        AND blocking_locks.transactionid IS NOT DISTINCT FROM blocked_locks.transactionid
        AND blocking_locks.classid IS NOT DISTINCT FROM blocked_locks.classid
        AND blocking_locks.objid IS NOT DISTINCT FROM blocked_locks.objid
        AND blocking_locks.objsubid IS NOT DISTINCT FROM blocked_locks.objsubid
        AND blocking_locks.pid != blocked_locks.pid
    JOIN pg_catalog.pg_stat_activity blocking_activity ON blocking_activity.pid = blocking_locks.pid
WHERE NOT blocked_locks.GRANTED;
```

#### **Index Usage Analysis**
```sql
-- Index usage statistics
SELECT 
    schemaname,
    tablename,
    indexname,
    idx_scan,
    idx_tup_read,
    idx_tup_fetch,
    pg_size_pretty(pg_relation_size(indexname::regclass)) AS index_size
FROM pg_stat_user_indexes 
ORDER BY idx_scan DESC;

-- Unused indexes (candidates for removal)
SELECT 
    schemaname,
    tablename,
    indexname,
    pg_size_pretty(pg_relation_size(indexname::regclass)) AS index_size
FROM pg_stat_user_indexes 
WHERE idx_scan = 0
AND schemaname = 'public'
ORDER BY pg_relation_size(indexname::regclass) DESC;

-- Tables with low index usage (sequential scan heavy)
SELECT 
    schemaname,
    tablename,
    seq_scan,
    seq_tup_read,
    idx_scan,
    idx_tup_fetch,
    seq_scan::float / (seq_scan + idx_scan) * 100 AS seq_scan_percent
FROM pg_stat_user_tables 
WHERE (seq_scan + idx_scan) > 0
ORDER BY seq_scan_percent DESC;
```

### Buffer and Cache Analysis

#### **Buffer Cache Performance**
```sql
-- Buffer cache hit ratio by table
SELECT 
    schemaname,
    tablename,
    heap_blks_read,
    heap_blks_hit,
    CASE 
        WHEN (heap_blks_read + heap_blks_hit) = 0 THEN 0
        ELSE (heap_blks_hit::float / (heap_blks_read + heap_blks_hit) * 100)
    END AS cache_hit_ratio
FROM pg_statio_user_tables 
ORDER BY cache_hit_ratio ASC;

-- Index cache hit ratio
SELECT 
    schemaname,
    tablename,
    indexname,
    idx_blks_read,
    idx_blks_hit,
    CASE 
        WHEN (idx_blks_read + idx_blks_hit) = 0 THEN 0
        ELSE (idx_blks_hit::float / (idx_blks_read + idx_blks_hit) * 100)
    END AS index_cache_hit_ratio
FROM pg_statio_user_indexes 
ORDER BY index_cache_hit_ratio ASC;
```

## üö® Bottleneck Identification

### Common Performance Bottlenecks

#### **1. Slow Query Identification**
```sql
-- Long-running queries with execution plans
EXPLAIN (ANALYZE, BUFFERS, FORMAT JSON)
SELECT 
    b.booking_id,
    b.start_date,
    b.end_date,
    u.first_name,
    u.last_name,
    p.name AS property_name
FROM Booking b
    JOIN User u ON b.user_id = u.user_id
    JOIN Property p ON b.property_id = p.property_id
WHERE b.start_date >= CURRENT_DATE
    AND b.status = 'confirmed'
ORDER BY b.start_date
LIMIT 50;
```

#### **2. Index Efficiency Analysis**
```sql
-- Identify missing indexes for frequently scanned tables
WITH table_scans AS (
    SELECT 
        schemaname,
        tablename,
        seq_scan,
        seq_tup_read,
        idx_scan,
        seq_tup_read / GREATEST(seq_scan, 1) AS avg_seq_read
    FROM pg_stat_user_tables
    WHERE seq_scan > 1000
)
SELECT 
    schemaname,
    tablename,
    seq_scan,
    avg_seq_read,
    'Consider adding indexes' AS recommendation
FROM table_scans
WHERE avg_seq_read > 10000
ORDER BY avg_seq_read DESC;
```

#### **3. Connection Pool Analysis**
```sql
-- Connection states analysis
SELECT 
    state,
    COUNT(*) as connection_count,
    COUNT(*) * 100.0 / SUM(COUNT(*)) OVER() as percentage
FROM pg_stat_activity 
GROUP BY state
ORDER BY connection_count DESC;

-- Long-running transactions
SELECT 
    pid,
    now() - xact_start AS transaction_duration,
    query,
    state
FROM pg_stat_activity 
WHERE xact_start IS NOT NULL
    AND now() - xact_start > interval '10 minutes'
ORDER BY transaction_duration DESC;
```

## üîß Optimization Implementation

### Schema Adjustments

#### **1. Index Optimization Based on Query Patterns**
```sql
-- Add composite index for common booking queries
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_booking_user_status_date 
ON Booking(user_id, status, start_date) 
WHERE status IN ('confirmed', 'pending');

-- Add partial index for recent bookings
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_booking_recent_confirmed 
ON Booking(property_id, start_date, end_date) 
WHERE status = 'confirmed' 
    AND start_date >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '1 year';

-- Add covering index for property searches
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_property_location_covering 
ON Property(location, pricepernight) 
INCLUDE (property_id, name, description);
```

#### **2. Table Structure Optimization**
```sql
-- Add constraint to improve query planning
ALTER TABLE Booking 
ADD CONSTRAINT chk_booking_future_dates 
CHECK (start_date >= '2020-01-01');

-- Optimize data types for better performance
ALTER TABLE Review 
ALTER COLUMN rating TYPE SMALLINT;

-- Add missing foreign key indexes
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_payment_booking_id ON Payment(booking_id);
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_message_recipient_sent ON Message(recipient_id, sent_at);
```

### Query Optimization Examples

#### **Before Optimization: Inefficient Property Search**
```sql
-- Problematic query - no index usage
SELECT p.*, u.first_name, u.last_name
FROM Property p
    JOIN User u ON p.host_id = u.user_id
WHERE p.description ILIKE '%downtown%'
    AND p.pricepernight BETWEEN 100 AND 300
ORDER BY p.created_at DESC;
```

#### **After Optimization: Improved Property Search**
```sql
-- Optimized query - better index usage and filtering
WITH filtered_properties AS (
    SELECT property_id, host_id, name, pricepernight, created_at
    FROM Property 
    WHERE pricepernight BETWEEN 100 AND 300
        AND to_tsvector('english', description) @@ to_tsquery('english', 'downtown')
)
SELECT 
    fp.property_id,
    fp.name,
    fp.pricepernight,
    u.first_name,
    u.last_name
FROM filtered_properties fp
    JOIN User u ON fp.host_id = u.user_id
ORDER BY fp.created_at DESC
LIMIT 20;
```

### Configuration Optimization

#### **PostgreSQL Configuration Tuning**
```sql
-- Analyze current configuration
SHOW ALL;

-- Key parameters for performance tuning:
-- shared_buffers = 25% of RAM (for dedicated DB server)
-- effective_cache_size = 75% of RAM
-- work_mem = (Total RAM - shared_buffers) / max_connections / 4
-- maintenance_work_mem = 10% of RAM (max 2GB)
-- checkpoint_completion_target = 0.9
-- wal_buffers = 16MB
-- default_statistics_target = 100
```

## üìà Performance Improvement Results

### Optimization Impact Tracking

#### **Query Performance Improvements**
```sql
-- Track performance improvements over time
WITH performance_comparison AS (
    SELECT 
        LEFT(query, 100) AS query_sample,
        calls,
        total_time,
        mean_time,
        LAG(mean_time) OVER (PARTITION BY LEFT(query, 100) ORDER BY calls) AS previous_mean_time
    FROM pg_stat_statements
    WHERE calls > 100
)
SELECT 
    query_sample,
    calls,
    mean_time,
    previous_mean_time,
    CASE 
        WHEN previous_mean_time > 0 THEN 
            ((previous_mean_time - mean_time) / previous_mean_time * 100)
        ELSE NULL 
    END AS improvement_percentage
FROM performance_comparison
WHERE previous_mean_time IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY improvement_percentage DESC NULLS LAST;
```

#### **Resource Usage Optimization**
```sql
-- Monitor resource usage trends
SELECT 
    date_trunc('hour', now()) AS hour,
    AVG(CASE WHEN state = 'active' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS avg_active_connections,
    AVG(CASE WHEN wait_event_type IS NOT NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS avg_waiting_connections
FROM pg_stat_activity
GROUP BY date_trunc('hour', now())
ORDER BY hour DESC
LIMIT 24;
```
